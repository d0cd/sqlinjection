#
# -- [[ Introduction ]] --------------------------------------------------------
#
# The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a set of generic attack
# detection rules that provide a base level of protection for any web
# application. They are written for the open source, cross-platform
# ModSecurity Web Application Firewall.
#
# See also:
# https://modsecurity.org/crs/
# https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs
# https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project
#


#
# -- [[ System Requirements ]] -------------------------------------------------
#
# CRS requires ModSecurity version 2.8.0 or above.
# We recommend to always use the newest ModSecurity version.
#
# The configuration directives/settings in this file are used to control
# the OWASP ModSecurity CRS. These settings do **NOT** configure the main
# ModSecurity settings (modsecurity.conf) such as SecRuleEngine,
# SecRequestBodyAccess, SecAuditEngine, SecDebugLog, and XML processing.
#
# The CRS assumes that modsecurity.conf has been loaded. If you don't have this
# file, you can get it from:
# https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/blob/master/modsecurity.conf-recommended
#
# The order of file inclusion in your webserver configuration should always be:
# 1. modsecurity.conf
# 2. crs-setup.conf (this file)
# 3. rules/*.conf (the CRS rule files)
#
# Please refer to the INSTALL file for detailed installation instructions.
#


#
# -- [[ Mode of Operation: Anomaly Scoring vs. Self-Contained ]] ---------------
#
# The CRS can run in two modes:
#
# -- [[ Anomaly Scoring Mode (default) ]] --
# In CRS3, anomaly mode is the default and recommended mode, since it gives the
# most accurate log information and offers the most flexibility in setting your
# blocking policies. It is also called "collaborative detection mode".
# In this mode, each matching rule increases an 'anomaly score'.
# At the conclusion of the inbound rules, and again at the conclusion of the
# outbound rules, the anomaly score is checked, and the blocking evaluation
# rules apply a disruptive action, by default returning an error 403.
#
# -- [[ Self-Contained Mode ]] --
# In this mode, rules apply an action instantly. This was the CRS2 default.
# It can lower resource usage, at the cost of less flexibility in blocking policy
# and less informative audit logs (only the first detected threat is logged).
# Rules inherit the disruptive action that you specify (i.e. deny, drop, etc).
# The first rule that matches will execute this action. In most cases this will
# cause evaluation to stop after the first rule has matched, similar to how many
# IDSs function.
#
# -- [[ Alert Logging Control ]] --
# In the mode configuration, you must also adjust the desired logging options.
# There are three common options for dealing with logging. By default CRS enables
# logging to the webserver error log (or Event viewer) plus detailed logging to
# the ModSecurity audit log (configured under SecAuditLog in modsecurity.conf).
#
# - To log to both error log and ModSecurity audit log file, use: "log,auditlog"
# - To log *only* to the ModSecurity audit log file, use: "nolog,auditlog"
# - To log *only* to the error log file, use: "log,noauditlog"
#
# Examples for the various modes follow.
# You must leave one of the following options enabled.
# Note that you must specify the same line for phase:1 and phase:2.
#

# Default: Anomaly Scoring mode, log to error log, log to ModSecurity audit log
# - By default, offending requests are blocked with an error 403 response.
# - To change the disruptive action, see RESPONSE-999-EXCEPTIONS.conf.example
#   and review section 'Changing the Disruptive Action for Anomaly Mode'.
# - In Apache, you can use ErrorDocument to show a friendly error page or
#   perform a redirect: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/custom-error.html
#
SecDefaultAction "phase:1,log,auditlog,pass"
SecDefaultAction "phase:2,log,auditlog,pass"

# Example: Anomaly Scoring mode, log only to ModSecurity audit log
# - By default, offending requests are blocked with an error 403 response.
# - To change the disruptive action, see RESPONSE-999-EXCEPTIONS.conf.example
#   and review section 'Changing the Disruptive Action for Anomaly Mode'.
# - In Apache, you can use ErrorDocument to show a friendly error page or
#   perform a redirect: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/custom-error.html
#
# SecDefaultAction "phase:1,nolog,auditlog,pass"
# SecDefaultAction "phase:2,nolog,auditlog,pass"

# Example: Self-contained mode, return error 403 on blocking
# - In this configuration the default disruptive action becomes 'deny'. After a
#   rule triggers, it will stop processing the request and return an error 403.
# - You can also use a different error status, such as 404, 406, et cetera.
# - In Apache, you can use ErrorDocument to show a friendly error page or
#   perform a redirect: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/custom-error.html
#
# SecDefaultAction "phase:1,log,auditlog,deny,status:403"
# SecDefaultAction "phase:2,log,auditlog,deny,status:403"

# Example: Self-contained mode, redirect back to homepage on blocking
# - In this configuration the 'tag' action includes the Host header data in the
#   log. This helps to identify which virtual host triggered the rule (if any).
# - Note that this might cause redirect loops in some situations; for example
#   if a Cookie or User-Agent header is blocked, it will also be blocked when
#   the client subsequently tries to access the homepage. You can also redirect
#   to another custom URL.
# SecDefaultAction "phase:1,log,auditlog,redirect:'http://%{request_headers.host}/',tag:'Host: %{request_headers.host}'"
# SecDefaultAction "phase:2,log,auditlog,redirect:'http://%{request_headers.host}/',tag:'Host: %{request_headers.host}'"


#
# -- [[ Paranoia Level Initialization ]] ---------------------------------------
#
# The Paranoia Level (PL) setting allows you to choose the desired level
# of rule checks.
#
# With each paranoia level increase, the CRS enables additional rules
# giving you a higher level of security. However, higher paranoia levels
# also increase the possibility of blocking some legitimate traffic due to
# false alarms (also named false positives or FPs). If you use higher
# paranoia levels, it is likely that you will need to add some exclusion
# rules for certain requests and applications receiving complex input.
#
# - A paranoia level of 1 is default. In this level, most core rules
#   are enabled. PL1 is advised for beginners, installations
#   covering many different sites and applications, and for setups
#   with standard security requirements.
#   At PL1 you should face FPs rarely. If you encounter FPs, please
#   open an issue on the CRS GitHub site and don't forget to attach your
#   complete Audit Log record for the request with the issue.
# - Paranoia level 2 includes many extra rules, for instance enabling
#   many regexp-based SQL and XSS injection protections, and adding
#   extra keywords checked for code injections. PL2 is advised
#   for moderate to experienced users desiring more complete coverage
#   and for installations with elevated security requirements.
#   PL2 comes with some FPs which you need to handle.
# - Paranoia level 3 enables more rules and keyword lists, and tweaks
#   limits on special characters used. PL3 is aimed at users experienced
#   at the handling of FPs and at installations with a high security
#   requirement.
# - Paranoia level 4 further restricts special characters.
#   The highest level is advised for experienced users protecting
#   installations with very high security requirements. Running PL4 will
#   likely produce a very high number of FPs which have to be
#   treated before the site can go productive.
#
# Rules in paranoia level 2 or higher will log their PL to the audit log;
# example: [tag "paranoia-level/2"]. This allows you to deduct from the
# audit log how the WAF behavior is affected by paranoia level.
#
# Uncomment this rule to change the default:
#
#SecAction \
#  "id:900000,\
#   phase:1,\
#   nolog,\
#   pass,\
#   t:none,\
#   setvar:tx.paranoia_level=1"


#
# -- [[ Anomaly Mode Severity Levels ]] ----------------------------------------
#
# Each rule in the CRS has an associated severity level.
# These are the default scoring points for each severity level.
# These settings will be used to increment the anomaly score if a rule matches.
# You may adjust these points to your liking, but this is usually not needed.
#
# - CRITICAL severity: Anomaly Score of 5.
#       Mostly generated by the application attack rules (93x and 94x files).
# - ERROR severity: Anomaly Score of 4.
#       Generated mostly from outbound leakage rules (95x files).
# - WARNING severity: Anomaly Score of 3.
#       Generated mostly by malicious client rules (91x files).
# - NOTICE severity: Anomaly Score of 2.
#       Generated mostly by the protocol rules (92x files).
#
# In anomaly mode, these scores are cumulative.
# So it's possible for a request to hit multiple rules.
#
# (Note: In this file, we use 'phase:1' to set CRS configuration variables.
# In general, 'phase:request' is used. However, we want to make absolutely sure
# that all configuration variables are set before the CRS rules are processed.)
#
#SecAction \
# "id:900100,\
#  phase:1,\
#  nolog,\
#  pass,\
#  t:none,\
#  setvar:tx.critical_anomaly_score=5,\
#  setvar:tx.error_anomaly_score=4,\
#  setvar:tx.warning_anomaly_score=3,\
#  setvar:tx.notice_anomaly_score=2"


#
# -- [[ Anomaly Mode Blocking Threshold Levels ]] ------------------------------
#
# Here, you can specify at which cumulative anomaly score an inbound request,
# or outbound response, gets blocked.
#
# Most detected inbound threats will give a critical score of 5.
# Smaller violations, like violations of protocol/standards, carry lower scores.
#
# [ At default value ]
# If you keep the blocking thresholds at the defaults, the CRS will work
# similarly to previous CRS versions: a single critical rule match will cause
# the request to be blocked and logged.
#
# [ Using higher values ]
# If you want to make the CRS less sensitive, you can increase the blocking
# thresholds, for instance to 7 (which would require multiple rule matches
# before blocking) or 10 (which would require at least two critical alerts - or
# a combination of many lesser alerts), or even higher. However, increasing the
# thresholds might cause some attacks to bypass the CRS rules or your policies.
#
# [ New deployment strategy: Starting high and decreasing ]
# It is a common practice to start a fresh CRS installation with elevated
# anomaly scoring thresholds (>100) and then lower the limits as your
# confidence in the setup grows. You may also look into the Sampling
# Percentage section below for a different strategy to ease into a new
# CRS installation.
#
# [ Anomaly Threshold / Paranoia Level Quadrant ]
#
#     High Anomaly Limit   |   High Anomaly Limit
#     Low Paranoia Level   |   High Paranoia Level
#     -> Fresh Site        |   -> Experimental Site
# ------------------------------------------------------
#     Low Anomaly Limit    |   Low Anomaly Limit
#     Low Paranoia Level   |   High Paranoia Level
#     -> Standard Site     |   -> High Security Site
#
# Uncomment this rule to change the defaults:
#
#SecAction \
# "id:900110,\
#  phase:1,\
#  nolog,\
#  pass,\
#  t:none,\
#  setvar:tx.inbound_anomaly_score_threshold=5,\
#  setvar:tx.outbound_anomaly_score_threshold=4"

#
# -- [[ Application Specific Rule Exclusions ]] ----------------------------------------
#
# Some well-known applications may undertake actions that appear to be
# malicious. This includes actions such as allowing HTML or Javascript within
# parameters. In such cases the CRS aims to prevent false positives by allowing
# administrators to enable prebuilt, application specific exclusions on an
# application by application basis.
# These application specific exclusions are distinct from the rules that would
# be placed in the REQUEST-900-EXCLUSION-RULES-BEFORE-CRS configuration file as
# they are prebuilt for specific applications. The 'REQUEST-900' file is
# designed for users to add their own custom exclusions. Note, using these
# application specific exclusions may loosen restrictions of the CRS,
# especially if used with an application they weren't designed for. As a result
# they should be applied with care.
# To use this functionality you must specify a supported application. To do so
# uncomment rule 900130. In addition to uncommenting the rule you will need to
# specify which application(s) you'd like to enable exclusions for. Only a
# (very) limited set of applications are currently supported, please use the
# filenames prefixed with 'REQUEST-903' to guide you in your selection.
# Such filenames use the following convention:
# REQUEST-903.9XXX-{APPNAME}-EXCLUSIONS-RULES.conf
#
# It is recommended if you run multiple web applications on your site to limit
# the effects of the exclusion to only the path where the excluded webapp
# resides using a rule similar to the following example:
# SecRule REQUEST_URI "@beginsWith /wordpress/" setvar:crs_exclusions_wordpress=1

#
# Modify and uncomment this rule to select which application:
#
#SecAction \
# "id:900130,\
#  phase:1,\
#  nolog,\
#  pass,\
#  t:none,\
#  setvar:tx.crs_exclusions_drupal=1,\
#  setvar:tx.crs_exclusions_wordpress=1"

#
# -- [[ HTTP Policy Settings ]] ------------------------------------------------
#
# This section defines your policies for the HTTP protocol, such as:
# - allowed HTTP versions, HTTP methods, allowed request Content-Types
# - forbidden file extensions (e.g. .bak, .sql) and request headers (e.g. Proxy)
#
# These variables are used in the following rule files:
# - REQUEST-911-METHOD-ENFORCEMENT.conf
# - REQUEST-912-DOS-PROTECTION.conf
# - REQUEST-920-PROTOCOL-ENFORCEMENT.conf

# HTTP methods that a client is allowed to use.
# Default: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS

# -- [[ Easing In / Sampling Percentage ]] -------------------------------------
#
# Adding the Core Rule Set to an existing productive site can lead to false
# positives, unexpected performance issues and other undesired side effects.
#
# It can be beneficial to test the water first by enabling the CRS for a
# limited number of requests only and then, when you have solved the issues (if
# any) and you have confidence in the setup, to raise the ratio of requests
# being sent into the ruleset.
#
# Adjust the percentage of requests that are funnelled into the Core Rules by
# setting TX.sampling_percentage below. The default is 100, meaning that every
# request gets checked by the CRS.  The selection of requests, which are going
# to be checked, is based on a pseudo random number generated by ModSecurity.
#
# If a request is allowed to pass without being checked by the CRS, there is no
# entry in the audit log (for performance reasons), but an error log entry is
# written.  If you want to disable the error log entry, then issue the
# following directive somewhere after the inclusion of the CRS
# (E.g., RESPONSE-999-EXCEPTIONS.conf).
#
# SecRuleUpdateActionById 901150 "nolog"
#
# ATTENTION: If this TX.sampling_percentage is below 100, then some of the
# requests will bypass the Core Rules completely and you lose the ability to
# protect your service with ModSecurity.

# -- [[ Project Honey Pot HTTP Blacklist ]] ------------------------------------
#
# Optionally, you can check the client IP address against the Project Honey Pot
# HTTPBL (dnsbl.httpbl.org). In order to use this, you need to register to get a
# free API key. Set it here with SecHttpBlKey.
#

#
# -- [[ GeoIP Database ]] ------------------------------------------------------
#
# There are some rulesets that inspect geolocation data of the client IP address
# (geoLookup). The CRS uses geoLookup to implement optional country blocking.
#
# To use geolocation, we make use of the MaxMind GeoIP database.
# This database is not included with the CRS and must be downloaded.
# You should also update the database regularly, for instance every month.
# The CRS contains a tool to download it to util/geo-location/GeoIP.dat:
#   util/upgrade.py --geoip
#
# This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from:
# http://www.maxmind.com.
#

#
# -=[ Block Countries ]=-
#
# Rules in the IP Reputation file can check the client against a list of high
# risk country codes. These countries have to be defined in the variable
# tx.high_risk_country_codes via their ISO 3166 two-letter country code:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements
#
# If you are sure that you are not getting any legitimate requests from a given
# country, then you can disable all access from that country via this variable.
# The rule performing the test has the rule id 910100.
#
# This rule requires SecGeoLookupDB to be enabled and the GeoIP database to be
# downloaded (see the section "GeoIP Database" above.)
#
# By default, the list is empty. A list used by some sites was the following:
# setvar:'tx.high_risk_country_codes=UA ID YU LT EG RO BG TR RU PK MY CN'"

# -- [[ Anti-Automation / DoS Protection ]] ------------------------------------
#
# Optional DoS protection against clients making requests too quickly.
#
# When a client is making more than 100 requests (excluding static files) within
# 60 seconds, this is considered a 'burst'. After two bursts, the client is
# blocked for 600 seconds.
#
# Requests to static files are not counted towards DoS; they are listed in the
# 'tx.static_extensions' setting, which you can change in this file (see
# section "HTTP Policy Settings").
#
# For a detailed description, see rule file REQUEST-912-DOS-PROTECTION.conf.

#
# -- [[ Check UTF-8 encoding ]] ------------------------------------------------
#
# The CRS can optionally check request contents for invalid UTF-8 encoding.
# We only want to apply this check if UTF-8 encoding is actually used by the
# site; otherwise it will result in false positives.
#
# Uncomment this rule to use this feature:

#
# -- [[ Blocking Based on IP Reputation ]] ------------------------------------
#
# Blocking based on reputation is permanent in the CRS. Unlike other rules,
# which look at the indvidual request, the blocking of IPs is based on
# a persistent record in the IP collection, which remains active for a
# certain amount of time.
#
# There are two ways an individual client can become flagged for blocking:
# - External information (RBL, GeoIP, etc.)
# - Internal information (Core Rules)
#
# The record in the IP collection carries a flag, which tags requests from
# individual clients with a flag named IP.reput_block_flag.
# But the flag alone is not enough to have a client blocked. There is also
# a global switch named tx.do_reput_block. This is off by default. If you set
# it to 1 (=On), requests from clients with the IP.reput_block_flag will
# be blocked for a certain duration.
#
# Variables
# ip.reput_block_flag      Blocking flag for the IP collection record
# ip.reput_block_reason    Reason (= rule message) that caused to blocking flag
# tx.do_reput_block        Switch deciding if we really block based on flag
# tx.reput_block_duration  Setting to define the duration of a block
#
# It may be important to know, that all the other core rules are skipped for
# requests, when it is clear that they carry the blocking flag in question.
#

#
# -- [[ Collection timeout ]] --------------------------------------------------
#
# Set the SecCollectionTimeout directive from the ModSecurity default (1 hour)
# to a lower setting which is appropriate to most sites.
# This increases performance by cleaning out stale collection (block) entries.
#
# This value should be greater than or equal to:
# tx.reput_block_duration (see section "Blocking Based on IP Reputation") and
# tx.dos_block_timeout (see section "Anti-Automation / DoS Protection").
#
# Ref: https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual#wiki-SecCollectionTimeout

# Please keep this directive uncommented.
# Default: 600 (10 minutes)
SecCollectionTimeout 600


#
# -- [[ Debug Mode ]] ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# To enable rule development and debugging, CRS has an optional debug mode
# that does not block a request, but instead sends detection information
# back to the HTTP client.
#
# This functionality is currently only supported with the Apache web server.
# The Apache mod_headers module is required.
#
# In debug mode, the webserver inserts "X-WAF-Events" / "X-WAF-Score"
# response headers whenever a debug client makes a request. Example:
#
#   # curl -v 'http://192.168.1.100/?foo=../etc/passwd'
#   X-WAF-Events: TX:930110-OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/DIR_TRAVERSAL-REQUEST_URI,
#                TX:930120-OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/FILE_INJECTION-ARGS:foo,
#                TX:932160-OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/RCE-ARGS:foo
#   X-WAF-Score: Total=15; sqli=0; xss=0; rfi=0; lfi=10; rce=5; php=0; http=0; ses=0
#
# To enable debug mode, include the RESPONSE-981-DEBUG.conf file.
# This file resides in a separate folder, as it is not compatible with
# nginx and IIS.
#
# You must specify the source IP address/network where you will be running the
# tests from. The source IP will BYPASS all CRS blocking, and will be sent the
# response headers as specified above. Be careful to only list your private
# IP addresses/networks here.
#
# Tip: for regression testing of CRS or your own ModSecurity rules, you may
# be interested in using the OWASP CRS regression testing suite instead.
# View the file util/regression-tests/README for more information.
#
# Uncomment these rules, filling in your CRS path and the source IP address,

# The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set is distributed under

# Please see the enclosed LICENSE file for full details.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# These exclusions remedy false positives in a default Drupal install.
# The exclusions are only active if crs_exclusions_drupal=1 is set.
# See rule 900130 in crs-setup.conf.example for instructions.

#
# [ POLICY ]
#
# Drupal is a complex application that is hard to secure with the CRS. This set
# of exclusion rules aims to sanitise the CRS in a way that allows a default
# Drupal setup to be installed and configured without much hassle as far as
# ModSecurity and the CRS are concerned.
#
# The exclusion rules are fairly straight forward in the sense that they
# disable CRS on a set of well-known parameter fields that are often the source
# of false positives / false alarms of the CRS. This includes namely the
# session cookie, the password fields and article/node bodies.
#
# This is based on two assumptions: - You have a basic trust in your
# authenticated users who are allowed to edit nodes.  - Drupal allows html
# content in nodes and it protects your users from attacks via these fields.
#
# If you think these assumptions are wrong or if you would prefer a more
# careful/secure approach, you can disable the exclusion rules handling of said
# node body false positives. Do this by placing the following directive in
# RESPONSE-999-EXCLUSION-RULES-AFTER-CRS.conf.
#
# SecRuleRemoveById 9001200-9001299
#
# This will mean the CRS remain intact for the editing of node bodies.
#
# The exclusion rules in this file work without the need to define a Drupal
# installation path prefix. Instead they look at the URI from the end - or
# they use regular expressions when targeting dynamic URL. This is all not
# totally foolproof. In some cases, an advanced attacker might be able to
# doctor a request in a way that one of these exclusion rules is triggered
# and the request will bypass all further inspection despite not being a
# Drupal request at all. These exclusion rules could thus be leveraged to
# disable the CRS completely. This is why these rules are off by default.
#
# The CRS rules covered by this ruleset are the rules with Paranoia Level 1 and
# 2. If you chose to run Paranoia Level 3 or 4, you will be facing additional
# false positives which you need to handle yourself.
#
# This set of exclusion rules does not cover any additional Drupal modules
# outside of core.
#
# The exclusion rules are based on Drupal 8.1.10.
#
# And finally: This set of exclusion rules is in an experimental state. If you
# encounter false positives with the basic Drupal functionality and they are
# not covered by this rule file, then please report them. The aim is to be able
# to install and run Drupal core in a seamless manner protected by
# ModSecurity / CRS up to the paranoia level 2.

#
# Anti-Automation rules to detect Denial of Service attacks.
#
# Description of mechanics:
# When a request hits a non-static resource (TX:STATIC_RESOURCES), then a counter for the IP
# address is being raised (IP:DOS_COUNTER). If the counter (IP:DOS_COUNTER) hits a limit
# (TX:DOS_COUNTER_THRESHOLD), then a burst is identified (IP:DOS_BURST_COUNTER) and the
# counter (IP:DOS_COUNTER) is reset. The burst counter expires within a timeout period
# (TX:DOS_BURST_TIME_SLICE).
# If the burst counter (IP:DOS_BURST_COUNTER) is greater equal 2, then the blocking flag
# is being set (IP:DOS_BLOCK). The blocking flag (IP:DOS_BLOCK) expires within a timeout
# period (TX:DOS_BLOCK_TIMEOUT). All this counting happens in phase 5.
# There is a stricter sibling to this rule (912170) in paranoia level 2, where the
# burst counter check (IP:DOS_BURST_COUNTER) hits at greater equal 1.
#
# The blocking is done in phase 1: When the blocking flag is encountered (IP:DOS_BLOCK),
# then the request is dropped without sending a response. If this happens, then a
# counter is # raised (IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER).
# When an IP address is blocked for the first time, then the blocking is reported in a
# message and a flag (IP:DOS_BLOCK_FLAG) is set. This flag expires in 60 seconds.
# When an IP address is blocked and the flag (IP:DOS_BLOCK_FLAG) is set, then the
# blocking is not being reported (to prevent a flood of alerts). When the flag
# (IP:DOS_BLOCK_FLAG) has expired and a new request is being blocked, then the
# counter (IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER) is being reset to 0 and the block is being treated
# as the first block (-> alert).
# In order to be able to display the counter (IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER) and resetting
# it at the same time, we copy the counter (IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER) into a different
# variable (TX:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER), which is then displayed in turn.
#
# Variables:
# IP:DOS_BLOCK              Flag if an IP address should be blocked
# IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER      Counter of blocked requests
# IP:DOS_BLOCK_FLAG         Flag keeping track of alert. Flag expires after 60 seconds.
# IP:DOS_BURST_COUNTER      Burst counter
# IP:DOS_COUNTER            Request counter (static resources are ignored)
# TX:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER      Copy of IP:DOS_BLOCK_COUNTER (needed for display reasons)
# TX:DOS_BLOCK_TIMEOUT      Period in seconds a blocked IP will be blocked
# TX:DOS_COUNTER_THRESHOLD  Limit of requests, where a burst is identified
# TX:DOS_BURST_TIME_SLICE   Period in seconds when we will forget a burst
# TX:STATIC_RESOURCES       Paths which can be ignored with regards to DoS
#
# As a precondition for these rules, please set the following three variables:
#  - TX:DOS_BLOCK_TIMEOUT
#  - TX:DOS_COUNTER_THRESHOLD
#  - TX:DOS_BURST_TIME_SLICE
#
# And make sure, that TX:STATIC_RESOURCES as also set.
#

# This rule checks if an Accept header exists, but has an empty value.
# This is only allowed in combination with the OPTIONS method.
# Additionally, there are some clients sending empty Accept headers.
# They are covered in another chained rule checking the User-Agent.
# This technique demands a separate rule to detect an empty
# Accept header if there is no user agent. This is checked via
# the separate rule 920311.

# Exclude some common broken clients sending empty Accept header:

# -=[ Abnormal Character Escapes ]=-
#
# [ Rule Logic ]
# Consider the following payload: arg=cat+/e\tc/pa\ssw\d
# Here, \s and \d were only used to obfuscate the string passwd and a lot of
# parsers will silently ignore the non-necessary escapes. The case with \t is
# a bit different though, as \t is a natural escape for the TAB character,
# so we will avoid this (and \n, \r, etc.).
#
# This rule aims to detect non-necessary, abnormal esacpes. You could say it is
# a nice # way to forbid the backslash character where it is not needed.
#
# This is a new rule at paranoia level 4. We expect quite a few false positives
# for this rule and we will later evaluate if the rule makes any sense at all.
# The rule is redundant with 920273 and 920274 in PL4. But if the rule proofs
# to be useful and false positives remain at a reasonable level, then it might
# be shifted to PL3 in a future release, where it would be the only rule
# covering the backslash escape.
#
# The rule construct is overly complex due to the fact that matching the
# backslash character with \b did not work. \Q\\\E does match the backslash
# character though. This is thus the base of the rule. We forbid the backslash
# when followed by a list of basic ascii characters - unless the backslash
# is preceded by another backslash character, which is being checked via a
# negative look-behind construct. If that is the case, the backslash character
# is allowed.

# [ Unix command injection ]
#
# This rule detects Unix command injections.
# A command injection takes a form such as:
#
#   foo.jpg;uname -a
#   foo.jpg||uname -a
#
# The vulnerability exists when an application executes a shell command
# without proper input escaping/validation.
#
# To prevent false positives, we look for a 'starting sequence' that
# precedes a command in shell syntax, such as: ; | & $( ` <( >(
#
# This rule is case-sensitive to prevent FP ("Cat" vs. "cat").
#
# An effort was made to combat evasions by shell quoting (e.g. 'ls',
# 'l'"s", \l\s are all valid). ModSecurity has a t:cmdLine
# transformation built-in to deal with this, but unfortunately, it
# replaces ';' characters and lowercases the payload, which is less
# useful for this case. However, emulating the transformation makes
# the regexp more complex.
#
# To rebuild the word list regexp:
#   cd util/regexp-assemble
#   cat regexp-932100.txt | ./regexp-cmdline.py unix | ./regexp-assemble.pl
#
# Then insert the assembled regexp into this template:

# [ Windows command injection ]
#
# This rule detects Windows shell command injections.
# If you are not running Windows, it is safe to disable this rule.
#
# A command injection takes a form such as:
#
#   foo.jpg&ver /r
#   foo.jpg|ver /r
#
# The vulnerability exists when an application executes a shell command
# without proper input escaping/validation.
#
# To prevent false positives, we look for a 'starting sequence' that
# precedes a command in CMD syntax, such as: ; | & `
#
# An effort is made to combat evasions by CMD syntax; for example,
# the following strings are valid: c^md, @cmd, "c"md. ModSecurity
# has a t:cmdLine transformation built-in to deal with some of these,
# but unfortunately, that transformation replaces ';' characters (so
# we cannot match on the start of a command) and '\' characters (so we
# have trouble matching paths). This makes the regexp more complex.
#
# This rule is case-insensitive.
#
# To rebuild the word list regexp:
#   cd util/regexp-assemble
#   cat regexp-932110.txt | ./regexp-cmdline.py windows | ./regexp-assemble.pl
#
# Then insert the assembled regexp into this template:

# [ Unix direct remote command execution ]
#
# Detects Unix commands at the start of a parameter (direct RCE).
# Example: foo=wget%20www.example.com
#
# This case is different from command injection (rule 932100), where a
# command string is appended (injected) to a regular parameter, and then
# passed to a shell unescaped.
#
# Due to a higher risk of false positives, the following changes have been
# made relative to rule 932100:
# 1) the set of commands is smaller
# 2) we require a trailing space (denoting command parameters) or command
#    separator character after the command
#
# To rebuild the word list regexp:
#   cd util/regexp-assemble
#   cat regexp-932150.txt | ./regexp-cmdline.py unix | ./regexp-assemble.pl
#
# Then insert the assembled regexp into this template:

# [ PHP Script Uploads ]
#
# Block file uploads with PHP extensions (.php, .php5, .phtml etc).
#
# Many application contain Unrestricted File Upload vulnerabilities.
# https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unrestricted_File_Upload
#
# Attackers may use such a vulnerability to achieve remote code execution
# by uploading a .php file. If the upload storage location is predictable
# and not adequately protected, the attacker may then request the uploaded
# .php file and have the code within it executed on the server.
#
# Also block files with just dot (.) characters after the extension:
# https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/08/15/time-to-patch-joomla
#
# Some AJAX uploaders use the nonstandard request headers X-Filename,
# X_Filename, or X-File-Name to transmit the file name to the server;
# scan these request headers as well as multipart/form-data file names.

#
# [ PHP Functions ]
#
# Detecting PHP function names is useful to block PHP code injection attacks.
# There are many PHP functions. We have to strike a balance between robust detection
# of PHP code in content, and the risk of false positives.
#
# The list of PHP functions is divided into four groups of varying attack/false positive risk.
# Four separate rules are used to detect these groups of functions:
#
# - Rule 933150: ~40 words highly common to PHP injection payloads and extremely rare in
#                natural language or other contexts.
#                Examples: 'base64_decode', 'file_get_contents'.
#                These words are detected as a match directly using @pmf.
#                Function names are defined in php-function-names-933150.data
#
# - Rule 933160: ~220 words which are common in PHP code, but have a higher chance to cause
#                false positives in natural language or other contexts.
#                Examples: 'chr', 'eval'.
#                To mitigate false positives, a regexp looks for PHP function syntax, e.g. 'eval()'.
#                Regexp is generated from function names in util/regexp-assemble/regexp-933160.data
#
# - Rule 933151: ~1300 words of lesser importance. This includes most PHP functions and keywords.
#                Examples: 'addslashes', 'array_diff'.
#                For performance reasons, the @pmf operator is used, and many functions from lesser
#                used PHP extensions are removed.
#                To mitigate false positives, we only match when the '(' character is also found.
#                This rule only runs in paranoia level 2 or higher.
#                Function names are defined in php-function-names-933151.data
#
# - Rule 933161: ~200 words with short or trivial names, possibly leading to false positives.
#                Examples: 'abs', 'cos'.
#                To mitigate false positives, a regexp matches on function syntax, e.g. 'abs()'.
#                This rule only runs in paranoia level 3 or higher.
#                Regexp is generated from function names in util/regexp-assemble/regexp-933161.data
#


#
# [ PHP Functions: High-Risk PHP Function Names ]
#
# Rule 933150 contains a small list of function names which are highly indicative of a PHP
# injection attack, for example 'base64_decode'.
# We block these function names outright, without using a complex regexp or chain.
# This could make the detection a bit more robust against possible bypasses.

#
# [ PHP Functions: High-Risk PHP Function Calls ]
#
# Some PHP function names have a certain risk of false positives, due to short
# names, full or partial overlap with common natural language terms, uses in
# other contexts, et cetera. Some examples are 'eval', 'exec', 'system'.
#
# For these function names, we apply a regexp to look for PHP function syntax.
# The regexp looks for a word boundary and adjoining parentheses.
# For instance, we want to block 'eval()', but we want to allow 'medieval()'.
#
# We have to be careful of possible bypasses using comment syntax. Examples:
#
#   system(...)
#   system (...)
#   system\t(...)
#   system /*comment*/ (...)
#   system /*multiline \n comment*/ (...)
#   system //comment \n (...)
#   system #comment \n (...)
#
# Regexp generated from util/regexp-assemble/regexp-933160.data using Regexp::Assemble.
# See http://blog.modsecurity.org/2007/06/optimizing-regu.html for usage.
# Note that after assemble, PHP function syntax pre/postfix is added to the Regexp::Assemble
# output. Example: "@rx (?i)\bASSEMBLE_OUTPUT_HERE(?:\s|/\*.*\*/|//.*|#.*)*\(.*\)"

# [ PHP Object Injection ]
#
# PHP Object Injection is an application level vulnerability that could allow
# an attacker to perform different kinds of malicious attacks, such as
# Code Injection, SQL Injection, Path Traversal and Application Denial of Service,
# depending on the context.
#
# The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized
# before being passed to the unserialize() PHP function. Since PHP allows object
# serialization, attackers could pass ad-hoc serialized strings to a vulnerable
# unserialize() call, resulting in an arbitrary PHP object(s) injection into the
# application scope.
#
# https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection
#
# In serialized form, PHP objects have the following format:
#
#    O:8:"stdClass":1:{s:1:"a";i:2;}
#    O:3:"Foo":0:{}
#
# Also detected are PHP objects with a custom unserializer:
# http://www.phpinternalsbook.com/classes_objects/serialization.html
# These have the following format:
#
#    C:11:"ArrayObject":37:{x:i:0;a:1:{s:1:"a";s:1:"b";};m:a:0:{}}
#    C:3:"Foo":23:{s:15:"My private data";}
#
# HTTP headers are inspected, since PHP object injection vulnerabilities have been
# found in applications parsing them:
# https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8562 (User-Agent header)

# [ PHP Functions: Variable Function Calls ]
#
# PHP 'variable functions' provide an alternate syntax for calling PHP functions.
# http://php.net/manual/en/functions.variable-functions.php
#
# An attacker may use variable function syntax to evade detection of function
# names during exploitation of a remote code execution vulnerability.
# An example to use the 'file_get_contents' function while evading rule 933150:
#
#   $fn = 'file_' . 'get_' . 'contents';
#   echo $fn('wp-co' . 'nfig.php');
#
# Some examples from obfuscated malware:
#
#   $OOO0000O0(...)
#   @$b374k(...)
#   $_[@-_]($_[@!+_] )
#
# A breakdown of the regular expression:
#
#   \$+

#
# [ PHP Variables: Common Variable Indexes ]
#
# In paranoia level 3, we add additional checks for parameters to many PHP variables.
#
#
# One of the more common variables used within attacks on PHP is $_SERVER. Because
# of how many different ways PHP has for executing variables (variable variables,
# etc) often just looking for $_SERVER will be less effective than looking for the
# various indexes within $_SERVER. This rule checks for these indexes.
# This rule is located in PL 3 because often developers will use these names as
# parameter names or values and this will lead to false positives.
# Because this list is not expected to change and it is limited in size we use a
# regex in this case to look for these values whereas in its sibling rule we use
# @pmf for flexibility and performance.
#
# To rebuild the regexp:
#   cd util/regexp-assemble
#   ./regexp-assemble.pl < regexp-933131.data
#
# This rule is a stricter sibling of rule 933130.

# [ PHP Functions: Low-Value PHP Function Calls ]

# Therefore, these function names are not scanned in lower paranoia levels.
#
# To mitigate the risk of false positives somewhat, a regexp is used to look for
# PHP function syntax. (See rule 933160 for a description.)
#
# This rule is a stricter sibling of rule 933160.
#
# Regexp generated from util/regexp-assemble/regexp-933161.data using Regexp::Assemble.
# See http://blog.modsecurity.org/2007/06/optimizing-regu.html for usage.
# Note that after assemble, PHP function syntax pre/postfix is added to the Regexp::Assemble
# output. Example: "@rx (?i)\bASSEMBLE_OUTPUT_HERE(?:\s|/\*.*\*/|//.*|#.*)*\(.*\)"

# NOTES
#
#  - Reference the WASC Script Mapping Project - http://projects.webappsec.org/Script-Mapping
#
#  - Not using closing brackets because they are not needed for the
#    attacks to succeed. The following seems to work in FF: <body/s/onload=...
#
#  - Also, browsers sometimes tend to translate < into >, in order to "repair"
#    what they think was a mistake made by the programmer/template designer.
#
#  - Browsers are flexible when it comes to what they accept as separator between
#    tag names and attributes. The following is commonly used in payloads: <img/src=...
#    A better example: <BODY onload!#$%&amp;()*~+-_.,:;?@[/|\]^=alert("XSS")>
#
#  - Grave accents are sometimes used as an evasion technique (as a replacement for quotes),
#    but I don't believe we need to look for quotes anywhere.
#
#  - Links do not have to be fully qualified. For example, the following works:
#    <script src="//ha.ckers.org/.j">
